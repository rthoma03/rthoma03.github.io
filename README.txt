Assignment 1 README

1. All aspects described in the spec seem to be implemented correctly. One of the parts of this assignment that was the most challenging for me was linking an image to my bio page. Once I realized I need to grant permission for the picture using chmod function, it was fairly straight forward. Creating the style page also was pretty time consuming for me.

2. I collaborated a little bit about Jarod Glover in our class. He helped me to understand how to transfer files from local to public-html.

3. This assignment probably took me about 5 hours.
