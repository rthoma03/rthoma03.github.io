Assignment 1 README

1. All aspects described in the spec seem to be implemented correctly. One of the parts of this assignment that was the most challenging for me was learning how the the different directories interact. I made the redirect from public-html to github way harder than it had to by transfering the whole Index to public-html as opposed to just sending the redirect link. Creating the style page also was pretty time consuming for me.

2. I collaborated with Jarod Glover in our class and Michael the TA. He helped me to understand how to transfer files from local to public-html.

3. This assignment probably took me about 7 hours.
